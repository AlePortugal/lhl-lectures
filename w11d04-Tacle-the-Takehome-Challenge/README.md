#### Tackle the Take Home Challenge

Today we talked about on how would you start looking into a take home challenge that you got from an employer.

#### Take Home Challenges - The Good, The Bad

Best part about take homes challenges:

 - the pressure is mostly off. All you have to is deliver a relatively small app, that will demostrate the skills you have.

 - It provides a more accurate work sample than whiteboard interviews or timed challenges.

 - if written well, it will have challenges that you will face on day to day basic at work.

On the flip side of the coin, these challenges are of a longer time, in essence a white boarding interview can be roughly 30 min - 1 h, where a take home, could take you 3 - 7 days to complete.

#### How to Approach

1. Time management and scope creep

2. Trying to learn too many new things at once

3. Making too many assumptions

4. Starting to code right away

###TLDR

Always approach the challenge with a plan. Create little milestones that will get you the final product.

TIME BOX EVERYTHING. Remember, to keep the project within the scope, and once the specs are met, then move on to stretch goals.

This is a great opportunity to learn new libraries, frameworks, and languages. Do not bite off more than you can chew. ( For instance if they ask for a frontend react, and backend to be watver you want it to be, but you learn that the backend of the company is ran on elixir, dont try to learn elixir in a week while trying to do the tech interview, it maybe too much)

ALWAYS take the time to review the requirements and make sure you fully understand them. And, if you have any questions at all, always ask.

Dont code right away!!!! ( YOU ARE NOT READY TO CODE!!!!!!) Remember our 2 lectures? First plan, then user stories, then draw erd, then draw mocks, then start!

Keep in mind that initial setup may take you a good chunk of your time, but it is very important because the intial setup of the project will structure how well everything else onward will go.

#### What to Do

1. Understand the requirements and ask any questions

2. Identify technical decisions you need to make

3. Technical design & whiteboarding

4. Test plan

5. App setup plan

6. Organize your tasks


#### Should i add testing?

Why should you include tests in your take-home coding challenge? Itâ€™s simple: your tests will make your submission shine.

#### What questions should i be asking when doing this

Asking yourself: what is the employer really looking to get out of this exercise? Just my coding skills? What about inquiry? Communication? Estimation / scope management?

What position was the challenge for?
