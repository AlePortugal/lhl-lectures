------------- Agenda -------------

- Ruby talk ( what, why, how )

RUBY

- Created by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto
- Rails created and made ruby popular
- Strinctly backend ( templates still doesnt consider to be ruby frontend)
- Not that super performant (concurency, threading )
- Easy Migrations
- mostly OOP 
- Fairly big library system ( buuuut not even close to NPM)
GEMS

JS
- frontend and backend 
- Has some pretty good perfomance
- PG does not
- mostly functional ( even though there are classes, they are basically syntactic sugar)
- A GIGANTIC library system ( NPM )

- Comparisons ( between ruby and js)
- BREAK - 
- More Comparisons
- BONUS (Classes)
