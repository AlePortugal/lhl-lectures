------------- Agenda -------------

- Ruby talk ( what, why, how )
- Ruby vs JS Comparisons
- BREAK - 
- More Comparisons
- BONUS (Classes) maybe?


------------ Ruby -----------------

Released in 1995 But became quite popular in the mid 2000's (2005-06)
Created by Yukihiro Matz (Matsumoto)
Got quite popular because of an MVC Framework called Rails (you will be learning about in next week)
David H --
can only run on the backend (no frontend works on ruby~~!~)
"Simplified enlgish-iy syntax"
Class based language
High Level abstractions
performance issues :(
    -> Ruby is sync lang (not async js)

very opinionated language
configuration over convention
Fairly big-ish package library vs JS MASSIVE A F package library
Established community


--------------- JS ------------------------
in 1995 but it was created in 10 days
both front and back-end 
more low level 
functional language with some class conversion
highly performant
 -> async 
Very very flexible
Very active community
