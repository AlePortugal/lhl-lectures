    summary: "<p>In the 1950's, America had broken free from the shackles of wartime economics. It was walking with the swagger of a Nation that had the world by the tail. Scientists had harnessed nuclear energy. Jetpropelled airplanes were breaking speed records... and the race to space was on! But perhaps more than anything else, one thing melded imagination and consumerism, putting this era in perfect context: The concept car. Unlike satellites, rockets, and jet planes these dream cars were accessible. People flocked to auto shows like GM's Motorama to see the concept cars in their titanium bodied glory. They were snapshots of how America perceived its future. Jaw dropping, unforgettable but what happened then? Most were destroyed. Some just plain vanished. But amazingly, some are still here and new series Mystery Cars is on a mission to find them.</p>",
