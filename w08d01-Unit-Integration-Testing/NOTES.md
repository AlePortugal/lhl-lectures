#### TESTING NOTES!!!

##### Why do we test?

- benefits of the long game
- catch errors/issues early on
- confidence (shoutout to Jimmy!!!)
- Time (not in the beginning....)
- Find Bugs
- getting other people started faster
- Because there's no more features to built *(when you do your take home interviews, write tests....)
- to prouve your app is robust

#### Types Testing

- unit and integration testing
- component testing
- error driven testing (prob happens in prod)
