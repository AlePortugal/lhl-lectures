--- WHY do we Test!?!?


- to improve confidence !!! 
- read through tests, see how things are implemented
- Enhance workflow
- Saves Time (in A LONG RUN!!!)
  ^---- everytime you push or commit or add a feature ALL YOUR TESTS RUN!

- ensure security
- edge cases ( happy path vs sad path)
- keep track of features
- MONEY ---
  - less downtime = more buisness time


### Types of Tests

Unit Testing --- tesing functions, true -- Cheap 
E2E --- testings out big features/ user stories (your wed) --- PRICEY 
Integration Testing --- Checking components, by themselves, are they working -- CHEAP 
static testing -- Linting, code checks, etc --- CHEAPEST
