#### Networking in Computers

Computers use a medium:

 - Cables
 - NIC
 - wifi
 - radio waves
 - bluetooth
 - NFC

 These mediums MUST HAVE some rules. The rules arent that different than human rules.

RULES --  Transmission Control  Protocol

 You got a link to the call
 You clicked on a link 
 You established a connection
 and then you are reciving information as time goes on

-- Server         Computer ---

Server turns on, and LISTENS to a connection
Computer (client) inputs the correct credentials where the server is located
IP  and  PORT
Client will attempt to connect to the server
When connection is established client can send messages
Server can recieve messages 
Server can send messages back to client or clients
Client can recieve messages 

Client can disconnect


When i refresh or use my browser 
I do "some sort" of TCP  
(its built upon TCP)

HTTP IS ANOTHER protocol

Computer (client) inputs the correct credentials where the server is located
Client makes a REQUEST to the server
connection gets established
server gives back a RESPONSE to the client
connection terminates



A CHAT CLIENT SERVER with TCP
