Transmission Control Protocol

TCP 

-- Server          --------------          CLIENT
Server LISTENS <-------
Client is able to connect to the server ( handshake )
Client can send messages and server on recieval of messages can decide on what to do with them:
 --- send it back
 --- send a brand new message

When Client disconnects, the server listens to that as well
