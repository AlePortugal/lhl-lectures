DATABASE

a program that is basically a box that contains information
and you are able to connect to it 
and you are able to run some sort of functions on it 
and you are able to filter, add, delete data , (talk to the DB)
and you are able to grab specific data
organization of data - ( Tables )
a language that is used to actually intreact with the DB (SQL) (OMFG ANOTHER LANGUAGE TO LEARN!?!!?)




Tables are a way to store information in an order
it also has structure ( tables have data structured to help us "search" the data)
