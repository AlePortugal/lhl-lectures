#### Don't Fear the Whiteboard!

The big question before going into a whiteboarding interview you should be asking, is WHY? Why am I doing this? What does this exercise show the company that isn’t already on my resume?


It turns out it’s less about your ability to get the right answer, and more about your problem-solving skills.

#### What do I do when I'm at the interview ?

 1 - Ask Questions

 Once you see the question, take a second, to understand what the question is asking, If something is unclear, or you need additional information, you can ask the interviewer for it.

 2 - Explain your solution/thought process

 After you have a game plan on solving the problem, talk through your solution. Talk it outloud. Being able to explain how you would approach an issue is the first way of showing how your brain thinks, this is great for the interviewer/developer to assess your method of thinking.

#### How to Practice these

 1 - Buy a whiteboard
 2 - Simulate an enviroment
 3 - Write code without compiling it to assume what needs to happen
